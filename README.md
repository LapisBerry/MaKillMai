## Contribution 📝
I need someone who can `draw character` for this game

I use [JavaFX][JavaFX-url] because I learn that from school. I don't have the plan to change to [libGDX][libGDX-url] and probably will never change it.

## Backstory 🗣️
I made this game because I want to learn about server socket and Server-Client Architecture.
